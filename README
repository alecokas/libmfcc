This is a fork of the libMFCC C library for computing Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (Version 0.1 - 5 October 2010) provided by Jeremy Sawruk at https://github.com/jsawruk/libmfcc

This repo aims to make the generation of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) more accessible to microcontrollers. By pre-computing the mel-spaced filterbank and converting double variables to floats, this library has been used to produce MFCCs on 256-point spectrum data using the Arduino Due at a reasonable speed (13 MFCCs in under a second).

Original Implementation based on:
"Musical Instrument Identification using Multiscale Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients" by Bob L. Sturm et al., 2010
